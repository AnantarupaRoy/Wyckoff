I’ll assume you meant **Pauling’s bond-valence (electrostatic valency) rule** (sometimes called the electrostatic valence principle): *the sum of the strengths of the electrostatic bonds reaching an anion equals the anion’s charge.* I’ll prove it algebraically for the ideal cubic perovskite ABO₃ and then do the same for MgAl₂O₄ (spinel).

# 1) Perovskite ABO₃ (ideal cubic)

Notation: let A have valence (v_A) and coordination number (CN_A); let B have valence (v_B) and coordination number (CN_B). In the ideal perovskite:

* (CN_B = 6) (B is octahedral).
* (CN_A = 12) (A sits in a cuboctahedral site).
* There is 1 A and 1 B per formula unit, and 3 O per formula unit.

Bond strength (Pauling): each cation–oxygen bond from a cation of charge (v) and coordination (CN) has strength (s=\dfrac{v}{CN}).

Count bonds per formula unit:

* Total A–O bonds = (CN_A = 12).
* Total B–O bonds = (CN_B = 6).
* Total cation–O bonds = (12+6=18).
* Per oxygen (there are 3 O): bonds per O = (18/3 = 6).

Breakdown per oxygen:

* Each O is bonded to 4 A atoms (because (12/3=4)) and 2 B atoms (because (6/3=2)).

So the sum of bond strengths at O:
[
\Sigma s(\text{at O}) = 4\left(\frac{v_A}{12}\right) + 2\left(\frac{v_B}{6}\right)
= \frac{4v_A}{12} + \frac{2v_B}{6}
= \frac{v_A}{3} + \frac{v_B}{3}
= \frac{v_A + v_B}{3}.
]

Charge neutrality of ABO₃ requires (v_A + v_B = 6) (because (v_A + v_B + 3\cdot(-2)=0)). Therefore
[
\Sigma s(\text{at O}) = \frac{6}{3} = 2,
]
which equals the magnitude of the oxide anion charge (|-2|). Thus Pauling’s rule is exactly satisfied for the ideal perovskite ABO₃.

Numeric example (typical case (A^{2+},B^{4+}), e.g. CaTiO₃):

* (s_A = 2/12 = 1/6) per A–O bond; O has 4 of these → (4\times 1/6 = 2/3).
* (s_B = 4/6 = 2/3) per B–O bond; O has 2 of these → (2\times 2/3 = 4/3).
* Sum (2/3 + 4/3 = 2).

# 2) Spinel MgAl₂O₄

Spinel formula is (AB_2O_4). For normal spinel (MgAl₂O₄):

* Mg is the A cation: (v_A = 2), and Mg occupies tetrahedral sites → (CN_A = 4).
* Al is B cation: (v_B = 3), Al occupies octahedral sites → (CN_B = 6).
* Per formula unit: 1 A (Mg), 2 B (Al), 4 O.

Count bonds per formula unit:

* A–O bonds = (1\times CN_A = 4).
* B–O bonds = (2\times CN_B = 12).
* Total cation–O bonds = (4+12=16).
* Per oxygen (4 O): bonds per O = (16/4 = 4).

Breakdown per oxygen:

* A–O bonds per O = (4/4 = 1) → each O is bonded to one A (tetrahedral).
* B–O bonds per O = (12/4 = 3) → each O is bonded to three B (octahedral).

Bond strengths:

* (s_A = v_A/CN_A = 2/4 = 0.5) per Mg–O bond.
* (s_B = v_B/CN_B = 3/6 = 0.5) per Al–O bond.

Sum at O:
[
\Sigma s(\text{at O}) = 1\cdot 0.5 + 3\cdot 0.5 = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2,
]
again equal to the oxide charge magnitude. So Pauling’s rule is exactly satisfied for MgAl₂O₄.

# Conclusion

For the ideal cubic perovskite ABO₃ and for the (normal) spinel MgAl₂O₄ the electrostatic valence (Pauling bond-valence) rule holds exactly: the sum of cation bond strengths at each oxide equals 2. The proofs above are purely algebraic and rely only on the coordination numbers and the valences required by charge neutrality.
